# Chopsticks2

This app is a simple implementation of the hand game called chopsticks. There is nothing impressive about it.
The first two commits (a majority of the code) was made in a couple hours after the contributers were inspired by the energy of a local
hackathon.

The app also does not work. If you want to make it work, go ahead.

## How to Play Chopsticks
Each player starts with one finger up on each hand. Whoever's turn it is, by tapping another person's hand, the player adds the number of 
fingers from the hand they tappeed to their own (Ex: If the current player has 2 fingers up and they tap someone with 3 fingers up, 
they change their hand so that it now has 5 fingers up, or 2 + 3.)

The winner of the game is supposed to get rid of both hands. In order to get rid of a hand, the player must add exactly to 10. If the finger they tap 
makes their total go over 10, they start over with the remainder (Ex: If the player has 8 fingers up and they tap someone with 3 fingers up,
they change their hand to have 1 again).
